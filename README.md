# BNPL Demo UI

This is a simple demo user interface built using very basic html & javascript. The purpose was to demonstrate a very specific use case relating Confluent cloud. It also demonstrates how javascript is used to call APIs on submit action and poll a second API endpoint until expected response is received. 

A simple demonstartion of how javascript handles poll methods with a promise that resolves in future, and how we can resolve the promise based on custom validations.

P.S: POC project with dummy end points, which may not be available in future
